### üìñ About The Project

This project is a web-based image classification tool. You can upload any image (JPG or PNG), and the application will use a deep learning model (MobileNetV2) to predict what's in the image. It displays the top 3 predictions with their confidence scores.

### üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

* **Python:** The core programming language.
* **Streamlit:** For creating the interactive web application.
* **TensorFlow / Keras:** For loading and using the pre-trained MobileNetV2 model.
* **OpenCV:** For image preprocessing (resizing).
* **Pillow:** For handling image files.
